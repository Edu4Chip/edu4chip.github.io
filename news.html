								<h3>First Edu4Chip Summer School on Chip Design held at DTU</h3>
								<p>
									11-22 August 2025
								</p>
								<p>
									The very first Edu4Chip Summer School, held at DTU, was a completely sold-out event that introduced 45 bachelor’s and master’s students from eight European universities to the full chip design process—from specification through design, implementation, verification, and testing.
								</p>
								<p>
									Over the week, students participated in lectures, hands-on sessions, keynote speeches, company presentations, and prepared group presentations. They also got opportunities to network, exchange ideas, and learn more about industry and academic strengths across Europe.
								</p>
								<p>
									The event was praised by both participants and organisers: survey responses highlighted satisfaction both socially and academically.
									Looking ahead, the next Edu4Chip Summer School will be held in France.

									<h3>Open-source verification presented at the FSiC 2024 conference</h3>
									<p>
										19 June 2024
									</p>
									<p>
										Stefano Minigutti from SyoSil presented the efforts to develop a framwork for open-source verification of digital ASIC/FPGA circuits at the Free Silicon Conference (FSiC) 2024 in Paris. The framework integrates open-source tools like Python-based UVM libraries into the semiconductor verification process, promoting accessibility, cost-efficiency, and allowing free use in education. This effort was part of the development of the new verification course at the Technical Univeristy of Denmark (DTU). The course aims to enhance the skills of students and professionals in chip design through practical, open-source solutions. This initiative is a key component of Edu4Chip's goals to modernize education in this field.
